This is my recipe project for the Odin Projet.
Hopefully I will be able to commit this project into Git without having to check the instructions.
So far I've learned to use the basic structure of html and its tags. I can now write paragraphs, make the text bold or italic, insert links and images. It was also helpful to learn to create directories through Terminal and to move files through it. I hope to get more control of Terminal as I progress in this course.

That's it for now.
